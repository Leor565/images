The dataset includes 64 images.
Recycling-bin are annotated in YOLO v3 Darknet format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)
* Auto-contrast via adaptive equalization

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
